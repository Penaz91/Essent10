Just a minimalistic (kinda) theme for Pelican
---------------------------------------------

This is a theme that came out while working on my blog, it has lots of customization and doesn't use a single JavaScript statement for its operation.

It is responsive and supports the new `prefers-color-scheme` CSS directive, for us dark-mode lords.

Search Box
----------

The search box has some options of its own which may need some explaining:

- `SEARCH_ENGINE_ADDR` is the address of the "search page" (for instance: `https://duckduckgo.com`)
- `TEXT_QUERY_NAME` defines the `name` of the searchbox input field, which will be sent to the search engine (for instance `q`)
- `SITE_LIMIT_VAR_NAME` defines the field that will be sent to the search engine to limit the search to our website (for instance `sites`)

If we use the settings in the above example, we will obtain the request `https://duckduckgo.com/?q=<our search>&sites=<our website>`.

I don't know how many search engines use this "get-based" approach, but I wanted to leave it configurable.

Tips
----

You may want to use `STATIC_PATHS` and `EXTRA_PATH_METADATA` to set some custom static files, without editing the theme directly (favicons, logos, etc...).
